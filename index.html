        Based off of your information, we believe that <strong>Python</strong> is the language that you should begin exploring! Python is a beginner-friendly, general-purpose computer programming language that can be used to build websites and software, automate tasks, analyze data, and much more. Many computer science courses introduce concepts using Python, so learning it now can help prepare you for your first class.

        Based off of your information, we believe that <strong>JavaScript</strong> is the language that you should begin exploring! JavaScript, or JS for short, is an object-oriented programming language and is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, making it a great tool to create websites and applications. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute code on users' devices.

        Based off of your information, we believe that <strong>C#</strong> is the language that you should begin exploring! C# (pronounced <em>C sharp</em>) is a high-level, general-purpose programming language developed by Microsoft. Many of today's tech companies primarily work with C#, so a proficiency with it could set you apart from the field and help you land a job.

        Since you are interested in learning how to code but do not have a goal for what you will use this skill for yet, we recommend that you start by exploring <strong>Python</strong>. Python is considered to be one of the more beginner-friendly languages, so practicing it will allow you to focus on learning core concepts while discovering if coding is something you will enjoy. However, this is simply a suggestion. There is no reason why a beginner developer cannot start by learning other languages such as JavaScript, C#, or Ruby.
